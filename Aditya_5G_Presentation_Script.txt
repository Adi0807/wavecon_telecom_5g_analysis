Presented by: Aditya Kumar

Slide 1: Introduction

HI everyone.  
I'm Aditya Kumar, and I’m excited to present my project titled “5G Impact Analysis for Wavecom Telecom.”  
This presentation is a part of the Codebasics Virtual Internship Program.  
Before I begin, I’d like to sincerely thank Dhaval Patel, Hemanand Sir, and the entire Codebasics team for their invaluable guidance, feedback, and constant support throughout this journey.

Here’s what I’ll be covering today:
1. A quick overview of key business metrics
2. What changed after the 5G launch
3. City and plan-level insights
4. Practical recommendations to move forward
5. Open floor for any suggestions or questions

To measure impact, I compared performance data from before 5G (Jan–Apr) and after 5G (Jun–Sep).

- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) improved by 11%, which is positive.
- However, overall revenue dropped slightly,
- Active users fell by over 7 million,
- And unsubscribed users rose by 23%.

This tells us that while the remaining users are spending more, many users are either not satisfied or find the service less valuable.

---



Let’s dive deeper into this:

- Revenue dipped slightly, despite the 5G launch — this points to slower-than-expected adoption.
- On the bright side, ARPU increased — especially in cities like Raipur, Ahmedabad, and Coimbatore — showing that the users who stayed are more engaged and likely using high-data plans.

Our takeaway: Fewer users, but higher value — we need to keep these users happy and build from there.

---



Now on to user retention:

- Active users dropped significantly in cities like Ahmedabad and Patna.
- Churn — or users leaving the network — increased sharply in Chennai, Coimbatore, and Chandigarh.

So while we are gaining more revenue per user, we are losing users faster than we’re gaining value — that’s not sustainable in the long term.

---



After the 5G rollout:

- Wavecom’s market share fell from 19.5% to 17.8%,
- While competitors, especially PIO, gained ground.

This shift indicates that we’re not keeping up with competitors, possibly due to lack of differentiation or user experience issues.

Suggested Focus Area for Stakeholders:  
Rather than heavy technical fixes, this is a great time to discuss marketing repositioning, customer loyalty programs, and enhanced onboarding experiences — ideas that align with business goals and can be brainstormed together by cross-functional teams.

---



City-wise breakdown shows:

- Mumbai still leads in revenue, but saw a drop in users.
- Patna has the highest ARPU — a strong market for testing new premium plans.
- Delhi had the highest user churn, indicating dissatisfaction that must be addressed.

This city-level data helps us tailor strategies — we can’t apply a one-size-fits-all approach.

---



Some key findings:

Top-Performing Plans:
- Smart Recharge Pack and Ultra Fast Mega Pack did very well — thanks to longer validity and more data, ideal for 5G users.

Struggling Plans:
- Rs.99 Talktime Pack and Mini Saver Pack saw major drops — likely because they don’t align with 5G-era needs.

Stakeholder takeaway: User behavior is evolving — the demand is shifting toward value-rich, data-heavy plans.

---



So, what did we learn?

1. Revenue per user increased, but user loss and churn are real concerns.
2. Wavecom lost market share to competitors — we need to act.
3. City and plan-level insights show where to double down and where to rethink strategy.

---



Here are my suggestions, designed to be practical and actionable:

- Reduce churn through loyalty rewards and simple auto-renewal offers
- Improve network experience in high-churn cities through focused audits
- Promote high-performing plans in cities like Patna and Raipur
- Phase out outdated plans that no longer meet user expectations
- Use personalization — smart suggestions based on user history
- Run localized campaigns — such as referral bonuses, OTT bundles, and student packs
- Reposition Wavecom’s brand as digital-first and user-centric

Thank you all for your attention.

Once again, I want to express my gratitude to Dhaval Patel, Hemanand Sir, and the Codebasics team — this internship gave me real-world experience that went beyond theory.

I now welcome any feedback, thoughts, or ideas you’d like to share — especially around customer engagement, marketing, or product offerings.
